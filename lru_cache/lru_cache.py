# LRU Cache(Least Recently Used)
# Cache has a limited size
# LRU Cache discards the least recently used item in the cache, when the cache is full(limit is reached)

# Data structures required:

# Hash table: need to be able to look something up with a key. Hash table allows us to quickly look up cache entries by key
# Doubly linked list: need to organize data to least and most recently used data
#   - DLL allows for movement of data to head(O(1))
#   - DLL allows for removal of data from the tail(O(1))

# Most recently used: most recently read or most recently added to the cache
# least recently used: will be discarded when new entry added, as tail holds the least recently used item

# Adding entries to the cache:
#   - if data exists
#       - check the hash with the provided key to see if key exists in cache
#       - move the entry to the head of the list

#   - if not in cache
#       - if hash is full (limit is reached), remove the tail item
#       - delete tail pointer from hash table
#       - create new node in list
#       - create key:value pair in cache that points to new node
#
#   - create a new node in DLL
#   - add hash table entry that holds pointer to new DLL node
#
#   - return the found / new item
#
# Get item from cache:
#   - if data exists in cache
#       - move entry to head of list
#       - return found item
#   - else
#       - return error 'item not found'
#
# Delete item from cache:
#   - if cache is at limit, remove item from tail
#   - delte tail pointer from hash table where key:value pair == removed node value
